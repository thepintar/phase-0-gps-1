#*What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
There wasn't anything in particular I was struggling with, but I certainly appreciated going through the process again a few times. I feel a lot more confident in the whole process after the challenge.

#*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
I got a clearer picture of what GitHub looks like when you work with someone else, and how to use the different tabs to browse through commits and the changes therein.

#*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
I don't recall us asking much apart from clarifying a few of the instructions when we were just getting started.

#*What still confuses you about git?*
I feel like I have a strong grasp of git now.

#*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
It started off a bit slow, but neither of us missed a beat and once we warmed up a little it was really easy and fun. I appreciated having another mind involved to help work through the challenge and I look forward to peer-pairing from here on out!
