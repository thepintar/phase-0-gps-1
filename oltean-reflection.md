#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?#
I don't think I was really struggling with any git concepts before the session. I got all of the kinks out yesterday, when I struggled a bit with the checkout command and may have accidentally cloned a repo in a repo.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?#
I would say solidified would be a better word to describe it. In watching someone else code and do the same thing I've been doing, and being able to pull changes made by someone else made a lot of sense.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?#
We didn't really ask a lot of questions - we worked through the material and went one by one with the instructions.

#What still confuses you about git?#
Some of the next conventions, for example putting in a new paragraph in your text. As well, adding some of the more exotic things like tagging people or emojis. If I can finish all of the required material this week, I will try to learn some of these features better.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?#
I thought it was really interesting, and I enjoyed it. I think the guide and my pair were both great. We got to business right away, and got the entire challenge done in about 1:30 minutes.
